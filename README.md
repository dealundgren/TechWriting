#Making Biltong

Biltong is what southern Africans call cured meat. The closest relative to it in the US is [beef jerky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerky), but there are substantial differences in taste and texture.

##Ingredients
- top grade beef
  * sirloin
  * tri-tip
  * rump
- spice rub
  - salt
    * 1/4 cup
  - pepper
    * 4 tablespoons
  - coriander
    * half a cup dried, ground seeds
  - chipotle pepper
    * 1 tablespoon, ground
  - brown sugar
    * 1 tablespoon
  - chili powder
    * 2 tablespoon
  - garlic powder
    * 4 tablespoons
  - cumin
    * 1 tablespoon
  - red wine vinegar
    * 1/2 cup


###Cut into strips

###Cover in salt

###Drizzle 2 tablespoons of vinegar over each

```javascript
function marinade(beefStrips){
  console.log('4 hours minimum in fridge');
}
```

###Remove from fridge and pat dry

###Apply seasoning frugally all over surface of each piece

###Hang in biltong box
  - ensure pieces are touching each other as little as possible

###Ensure environment is dry and well-ventilated

```javascript

  console.log('occasionally check to ensure they aren't touching');
}
